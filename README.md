# Introduction

In this project I will create an end-to-end pipeline using Apache Airflow, Bigquery, DBT, Soda and Metabase. You can check more about it on the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzxtCxi4YaA) that Marc Lambert made explaining the step by step process.

Each technology will have the following importance in this pipeline:

* Airflow: The orchestrate tool, responsible for move the files through each pipeline phase.
* Bigquery: The modern data warehouse, it'll store the information in tables such as the dimension and fact
* DBT: The shelter that will transform the raw data into dimension and fact tables.
* Soda: Used for quality check
* Metabase: The endpoint of our pipeline, will show our data but more in a business vision to analysts and decision makers

Our [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/online-retail) will come from kaggle and it's a .csv with sample data.
